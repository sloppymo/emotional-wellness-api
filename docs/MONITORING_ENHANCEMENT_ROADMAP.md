## Overview

This document outlines the roadmap for enhancing the Emotional Wellness API monitoring system, focusing on observability, reliability, security, and operational excellence while maintaining full HIPAA compliance.

## Current Implementation

The monitoring system currently includes:

* **Background Task Monitoring**: Celery worker status, queue depths, task execution metrics
* **Integration Health Monitoring**: External systems connectivity and performance
* **Prometheus Metrics Collection**: Request counts, latencies, task metrics, integration health
* **Health Check Endpoints**: System, worker, integration, and component health status
* **HIPAA Compliance Monitoring**: Security and compliance status reporting

## Enhancement Plan

The roadmap is structured into four phases, each building upon the previous to create a comprehensive monitoring ecosystem.

## Phase 1: Core Alerting & Dashboard

**Duration: 2-3 Weeks**

### 1. Automated Alerting System
* Implement `AlertManager` class to monitor metrics against thresholds
* Create configurable alert rules with severity levels
* Set up notification channels (email, SMS, Slack)
* Implement alert aggregation to avoid notification storms
* Define critical alerts for immediate action

### 2. Admin Metrics Dashboard
* Create real-time metrics visualization dashboard
* Implement system health overview with drill-down capabilities
* Display queue status, worker health, and integration statistics
* Add historical charts for trend analysis
* Implement role-based access controls for dashboard views

### 3. Security Monitoring Enhancement
* Add security-specific metrics (auth failures, access attempts)
* Implement rate limiting visualization
* Add API key usage tracking
* Monitor PHI access patterns
* Implement security event logging and alerting

## Phase 2: Advanced Analysis

**Duration: 3-4 Weeks**

### 4. Historical Metrics Storage
* Implement time-series database integration for metric history
* Create data retention and archiving policies
* Set up aggregation for long-term trend analysis
* Implement data compression for storage efficiency
* Create historical data query API

### 5. Anomaly Detection
* Implement statistical models for baseline behavior
* Create machine learning pipeline for anomaly detection
* Set up automated training on historical data
* Implement confidence scoring for detected anomalies
* Create anomaly investigation workflows

### 6. Performance Analytics
* Implement request latency breakdown analysis
* Set up bottleneck identification algorithms
* Create resource utilization prediction models
* Implement capacity planning tools
* Set up SLA/SLO tracking and reporting

## Phase 3: Proactive Management

**Duration: 3-4 Weeks**

### 7. Self-Healing Capabilities
* Implement automatic recovery for known failure scenarios
* Create retry mechanisms for integration failures
* Set up worker auto-scaling based on queue depth
* Implement circuit breakers for failing dependencies
* Create recovery audit logging

### 8. Distributed Tracing
* Set up OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
* Implement trace context propagation across services
* Create visualization for request flow and bottlenecks
* Set up trace sampling and storage
* Implement trace analysis tools

### 9. User Impact Analysis
* Create correlation between system issues and user experience
* Implement affected user identification
* Set up impact scoring for incidents
* Create automated incident response playbooks
* Implement post-incident analysis tools

## Phase 4: External Integration

**Duration: 2-3 Weeks**

### 10. Geographic Request Distribution
* Implement geo-location tracking for API requests
* Create geographic usage visualization
* Set up regional performance monitoring
* Implement data sovereignty compliance checks
* Create geo-specific alerting rules

### 11. External Monitoring Integration
* Set up integration with Datadog
* Implement New Relic exporters
* Create custom dashboards in external systems
* Set up cross-system alert correlation
* Implement SaaS monitoring cost optimization

### 12. Compliance Reporting
* Create automated HIPAA compliance reports
* Implement audit trail for monitoring system changes
* Set up scheduled security scanning
* Create compliance violation alerting
* Implement evidence collection for audits
