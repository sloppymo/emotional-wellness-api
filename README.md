## üß† Analytics Systems (Prototype Stage)

### VELURIA: Crisis Detection & Intervention

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/veluria_flow.png" alt="VELURIA System Flow" width="70%"/>
</p>

VELURIA is our advanced crisis pattern detection and intervention system, featuring:

- **Real-time Risk Assessment**: Multi-dimensional analysis across 8 domains (suicide, self-harm, violence, substance abuse, trauma, eating disorders, neglect, psychosis)
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses IsolationForest for anomaly detection
- **Temporal Pattern Analysis**: Identifies patterns in emotional state over time
- **Intervention Protocol Management**: Dynamic selection of appropriate interventions based on crisis type and severity
- **Effectiveness Analytics**: Measures and reports on intervention outcomes

```python
# Example: Using the VELURIA API for crisis assessment
from src.symbolic.veluria import CrisisPatternDetector

async def detect_patterns(user_id, emotional_states):
    detector = CrisisPatternDetector()
    result = await detector.analyze_patterns(
        user_id=user_id,
        emotional_states=emotional_states,
        timeframe_days=30
    )
    
    # Get risk prediction
    if result.risk_prediction.risk_level >= 3:  # High risk
        # Trigger intervention protocol
        await intervention_service.trigger_protocol(
            user_id=user_id, 
            risk_assessment=result
        )
```

### ROOT: Longitudinal Analytics

ROOT is our longitudinal analysis system that tracks emotional wellness over time:

- **Emotional Baseline Calculation**: Establishes user-specific baselines
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies meaningful changes and trajectories
- **Pattern Recognition**: Discovers recurring patterns in emotional states
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasts potential future states using RandomForestRegressor
- **Correlation Analysis**: Finds relationships between wellness factors

```python
# Example: Using ROOT for longitudinal analysis
from src.symbolic.root import ROOTAnalyzer

async def analyze_trends(user_id, start_date, end_date):
    analyzer = ROOTAnalyzer()
    
    # Calculate baseline and trends
    baseline = await analyzer.calculate_baseline(user_id, days=90)
    trends = await analyzer.analyze_trends(
        user_id=user_id,
        start_date=start_date,
        end_date=end_date,
        baseline=baseline
    )
    
    # Generate forecast
    forecast = await analyzer.forecast_state(
        user_id=user_id,
        days_ahead=14,
        trends=trends
    )
    
    return {
        "baseline": baseline,
        "trends": trends,
        "forecast": forecast
    }
```

### CANOPY: Metaphor Extraction & Symbolic Mapping

CANOPY provides metaphor analysis and symbolic mapping capabilities:

- **Metaphor Extraction**: Identifies underlying metaphors in user expressions
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Maps metaphors to culturally appropriate responses
- **Symbolic Integration**: Connects metaphorical expressions to clinical concepts
- **Multi-lingual Support**: Works across multiple languages and cultures

## üè¢ Architecture (Evolving Design)

### System Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/architecture.png" alt="Planned System Architecture" width="80%"/>
</p>

The Emotional Wellness API is being designed with the following architecture (subject to change during development):

- **FastAPI Backend**: Asynchronous API with dependency injection and middleware
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Separated domains for clinical, symbolic, and monitoring concerns
- **CQRS Pattern**: Command and Query Responsibility Segregation for complex operations
- **Event-Driven**: Pub/sub patterns for system events and notifications
- **Microservices-Ready**: Modular design that can be deployed as monolith or microservices

### Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**: User emotional states and clinical inputs are processed through API endpoints
2. **Risk Assessment**: VELURIA analyzes inputs for crisis patterns and risk levels
3. **Intervention Selection**: Protocol selection based on assessment results
4. **Longitudinal Storage**: Data stored for ROOT analysis with appropriate retention policies
5. **Analytics & Visualization**: Results presented through dashboards and API responses

## üêõ Troubleshooting (Alpha Development)

> **Note**: As this is alpha software, you may encounter additional issues not listed here. Please report them via GitHub issues.

### Common Issues

#### API Startup Issues

**Problem**: API fails to start with database connection errors.

**Solution**: 
- Verify PostgreSQL is running and accessible
- Check connection string in `.env` file
- Ensure database migrations are applied: `alembic upgrade head`

#### Worker/Celery Issues

**Problem**: Background tasks not running or failing silently.

**Solution**:
- Check Redis connection
- Verify Celery worker is running: `celery -A src.tasks.celery_app worker --loglevel=info`
- Check Celery logs for errors

#### Dashboard Access Issues

**Problem**: Can't access admin dashboard.

**Solution**:
- Verify admin role is assigned to your user
- Check JWT token validity
- Ensure frontend assets are properly served

#### Redis TimeSeries Issues

**Problem**: Metrics not appearing in dashboard.

**Solution**:
- Verify Redis TimeSeries module is installed: `redis-cli MODULE LIST`
- Check Redis connection settings
- Verify metrics collector service is running

### Performance Tuning

- **API Performance**: Adjust worker count in `uvicorn` or Gunicorn for concurrent requests
- **Database**: Add indexes for frequently queried fields
- **Caching**: Configure Redis caching for frequently accessed, read-heavy data
- **Task Queue**: Adjust Celery concurrency with `--concurrency=N`

### FAQ

**Q: Can the system handle multiple languages?**

A: Yes, CANOPY supports multilingual metaphor extraction and cultural adaptation.

**Q: What machine learning models are used?**

A: We use IsolationForest for anomaly detection, RandomForestRegressor for predictive analytics, and custom models for risk assessment.

**Q: Is the system suitable for clinical trials?**

A: While designed with clinical best practices, specific trial validation may be required depending on your research protocol.

**Q: How do I add a new metric to monitor?**

A: Use the `MetricsCollector` service to define and track new metrics. See [MONITORING.md](./MONITORING.md) for details.

```python
from src.monitoring.metrics_collector import MetricsCollector

# Register and track a new metric
await MetricsCollector.track_metric(
    name="user_engagement_score",
    value=85.2,
    labels={"user_type": "clinician", "feature": "dashboard"}
)
```
