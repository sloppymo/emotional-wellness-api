# Overnight Maintenance Status Report

## Current Situation

The overnight maintenance system is encountering a fundamental issue:

### Problem Identified
- **Test-Code Mismatch**: The test scenarios in `tests/maintenance/test_scenarios.py` expect features that don't exist in the current implementation
- **Missing Features**: Tests are looking for:
  - `emotional_state` attribute on Agent class
  - `update_emotional_state()` method
  - Trauma persistence system
  - Complex emotional modeling
  
### What's Actually Implemented
The current `Agent` class in `src/game/core.py` has:
- Basic attributes: id, name, faction_id, location_id, status
- Simple loyalty and stress values
- Skills system (combat, stealth, hacking, etc.)
- Equipment system
- No emotional state modeling

## Resolution Options

### Option 1: Fix Test Scenarios (Quick Fix)
Update the test scenarios to match the actual implementation. This would allow the overnight maintenance to run properly.

### Option 2: Implement Missing Features (Long Term)
Add the emotional state system and other missing features to match what the tests expect.

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
1. Create basic test scenarios that work with current implementation
2. Mark advanced tests as "pending" 
3. Run overnight maintenance on working tests
4. Gradually implement missing features

## Monitoring Your Overnight Maintenance

Since the maintenance is running in the remote workspace, you can:

1. **View logs remotely**: Ask me to check the latest logs
2. **Get status updates**: I can provide periodic updates on progress
3. **Check health metrics**: I can show the current system health scores

## Current Status
- **Location**: Running in `/workspace/years-of-lead/`
- **Health Score**: 0.625 (Narrative: 0.7, Emotional: 0.8, Performance: 1.0)
- **Test Coverage**: 0.0 (due to failing tests)
- **Complexity Budget**: 75 (unused due to test failures)

## Next Steps
Would you like me to:
1. Fix the test scenarios to match current implementation?
2. Restart overnight maintenance with working tests?
3. Implement the missing emotional state system?
4. Create a minimal working test suite for overnight maintenance?
