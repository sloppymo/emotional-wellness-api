## Crisis Levels and Definitions

The VELURIA system categorizes crisis situations into distinct levels that determine the response protocol:

| Level | Description | Response Time | Interventions | Example Indicators |
|-------|-------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Level 1** | Potential concern, non-urgent | 24 hours | Automated wellness check, resource provision | Mild negative symptom increase, subtle pattern changes |
| **Level 2** | Moderate risk, requires attention | 4 hours | Provider notification, outreach | Significant mood decline, concerning language patterns |
| **Level 3** | High risk, immediate intervention | 15 minutes | Emergency contacts, crisis services engagement | Explicit harm language, severe symptom escalation |

### Crisis Pattern Detection

VELURIA uses a combination of direct indicators and pattern analysis to detect potential crises:

- **Direct indicators**: Explicit statements of harm, severe symptom reports
- **Pattern indicators**: Unusual changes in emotional state over time
- **Contextual factors**: Recent life events, support system changes, clinical history

## VELURIA Protocol Workflow

The VELURIA crisis response protocol follows this standardized workflow:

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│              │     │              │     │              │     │              │

### Stage Details

#### 1. Signal Detection

The system continuously monitors emotional wellness data for potential crisis signals through:

- Text analysis for concerning language
- Emotional state vector changes
- Behavioral pattern shifts
- Clinical threshold breaches

**Technical implementation**: `src/symbolic/veluria/signal_detection.py`

#### 2. Pattern Analysis

When signals are detected, the pattern analysis module evaluates:

- Longitudinal emotional trends
- Contextual factors
- Crisis pattern matching against known patterns
- False positive elimination

**Technical implementation**: `src/symbolic/veluria/pattern_analysis.py`

#### 3. Crisis Verification

To minimize false alarms, crisis verification employs:

- Multi-factor confirmation
- Pattern intensity scoring
- Clinical threshold validation
- Historical context comparison

**Technical implementation**: `src/symbolic/veluria/crisis_verification.py`

#### 4. Level Assignment

The system assigns a crisis level based on:

- Severity scoring
- Urgency assessment
- Intervention requirements
- Risk stratification

**Technical implementation**: `src/symbolic/veluria/level_assignment.py`

#### 5. Response Mobilization

Based on the assigned level, the system mobilizes appropriate resources:

- **Level 1**: Automated wellness check, resource provision
- **Level 2**: Provider notification, scheduled outreach
- **Level 3**: Emergency contacts, crisis services engagement

**Technical implementation**: `src/symbolic/veluria/response_mobilization.py`

#### 6. Intervention Execution

The intervention is executed according to the crisis level:

- Communication via appropriate channels
- Escalation if no response
- Provider engagement
- Emergency services coordination if needed

**Technical implementation**: `src/symbolic/veluria/intervention.py`

#### 7. Case Closure

Each crisis case must be formally closed with:

- Resolution documentation
- Outcome recording
- Follow-up scheduling
- System learning integration

**Technical implementation**: `src/symbolic/veluria/case_resolution.py`

#### 8. Regulatory Reporting

For reportable events, the system handles:

- HIPAA-compliant incident reporting
- Regulatory documentation
- Privacy protection
- Required notifications

**Technical implementation**: `src/symbolic/veluria/regulatory_reporting.py`

## Response Team Roles and Responsibilities

Crisis response involves multiple roles with specific responsibilities:

### On-Call Crisis Responder

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- First point of contact for Level 2-3 alerts
- Initial response coordination
- Situation assessment and verification
- Response escalation as needed

**Response SLAs**:
- Level 2: Acknowledge within 15 minutes, respond within 4 hours
- Level 3: Acknowledge within 5 minutes, respond within 15 minutes

### Clinical Supervisor

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Oversight of clinical response
- Intervention approval for Level 2-3
- Provider coordination
- Clinical documentation review

**Involvement Criteria**:
- All Level 3 crises
- Level 2 crises with specific clinical factors
- Cases requiring provider coordination

### Technical Support

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- System functionality assurance
- Communications channel verification
- Technical issue resolution
- Response tool configuration

**Engagement Process**:
1. On-call technical support is notified for system issues
2. Troubleshooting within defined SLAs
3. Incident reporting for system failures

### Legal/Compliance Officer

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Ensuring HIPAA compliance during response
- Regulatory reporting requirements
- Documentation standards oversight
- Privacy breach prevention

**Engagement Process**:
- Automatic notification for all Level 3 crises
- Consultation for unusual situations
- Review of all emergency service engagements

## PHI Handling During Crisis Response

Crisis response requires careful handling of Protected Health Information (PHI):

### Minimum Necessary Principle

- Only share PHI absolutely necessary for crisis response
- Limit PHI in communications to the minimum required
- Redact non-essential PHI from notifications

### Secure Communications

- Use encrypted channels for all crisis communications
- Verify recipient identity before sharing PHI
- Document all PHI transfers in the audit log

### Emergency Disclosure Provisions

Under HIPAA, limited disclosures are permitted in emergencies to:
- Prevent serious harm to the patient or others
- Notify emergency contacts as previously authorized
- Coordinate with emergency services

**Technical implementation**:

```python
# Example of emergency disclosure handling in VELURIA
from src.security.phi_disclosure import emergency_disclosure_log

async def notify_emergency_services(patient_id, crisis_details, location_data):
    # Create secure disclosure package with minimum necessary PHI
    disclosure = await create_minimum_disclosure_package(
        patient_id=patient_id,
        required_elements=["name", "location", "crisis_nature"]
    )
    
    # Log the emergency disclosure for compliance
    await emergency_disclosure_log(
        patient_id=patient_id,
        disclosed_to="emergency_services",
        disclosure_reason="Level 3 crisis intervention",
        phi_elements=disclosure.disclosed_elements
    )
    
    # Execute the notification
    return await emergency_services_client.notify(disclosure.secure_package)
```

## Documentation and Reporting

Every crisis response must be thoroughly documented for clinical, legal, and quality purposes.

### Required Documentation

| Document | Timing | Contents | Storage |
|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Crisis Alert | Automatic | Detection details, level assignment, timestamp | HIPAA-compliant secure storage, 7-year retention |
| Response Record | During/after response | Actions taken, communications, outcomes | HIPAA-compliant secure storage, 7-year retention |
| Clinical Note | Within 24 hours | Clinical assessment, interventions, follow-up plan | EHR system with patient record |
| Incident Report | If applicable | System issues, response delays, adverse events | Incident management system, 7-year retention |

### Documentation Best Practices

1. **Be factual**: Document observable facts rather than interpretations
2. **Be thorough**: Include all relevant details of the crisis and response
3. **Be timely**: Complete documentation as soon as possible after the event
4. **Be precise**: Use clear language and avoid ambiguity
5. **Follow standards**: Adhere to clinical documentation standards and templates

### Reporting Requirements

| Report Type | Trigger | Recipients | Deadline |
|------------|---------|------------|----------|
| Monthly Summary | Calendar month end | Clinical leadership, compliance | 5th of following month |
| Critical Incident | Any Level 3 crisis | Clinical director, compliance officer | Within 24 hours |
| Regulatory Report | Reportable events per regulations | Appropriate agencies | As required by law |
| System Performance | Calendar quarter end | Technical leadership, QA team | 15th of following month |
