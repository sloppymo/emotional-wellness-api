## Executive Summary

The Emotional Wellness Companion API is a HIPAA-compliant SaaS platform designed to provide symbolic emotional analysis, real-time emotional state tracking, and crisis containment capabilities for mental health applications. The system leverages advanced NLP techniques and modular symbolic subsystems to process user inputs, track emotional patterns, and provide appropriate responses with special attention to crisis detection and intervention.

This document outlines the technical design and implementation strategy for building this API, with a focus on security, scalability, and compliance with healthcare regulations.

### High-Level Data Flow

1. Client sends emotional input data through secure API endpoints
2. API Gateway validates request and enforces authentication/authorization
3. Symbolic Engine processes input through CANOPY/MOSS subsystems
4. VELURIA crisis protocol evaluates for potential crisis states
5. System returns symbolic interpretation, drift index, and safety status
6. All interactions are encrypted, logged, and stored in compliance with HIPAA
