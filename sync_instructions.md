# Syncing Your Local Project to Remote Workspace

Since you're in Cursor, the easiest way is:

## Option 1: Using Cursor's Built-in Features (Easiest)
1. In your local Cursor window with the project open
2. Use the command palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P)
3. Look for "Remote" or "Sync" commands
4. Or simply drag and drop files from your local file explorer into this remote workspace

## Option 2: Using Git (If your project is already in git)
```bash
# First, check if you have a git remote
cd ~/Documents/Windsurf/emotional-wellness-api
git remote -v

# If you have a remote, push your latest changes
git add .
git commit -m "Sync latest changes"
git push

# Then in this remote workspace, I can clone it
# Just share the repository URL with me
```

## Option 3: Direct Copy Commands
From your local terminal:
```bash
# Using rsync (preserves permissions and is efficient)
rsync -avz ~/Documents/Windsurf/emotional-wellness-api/ user@remote:/workspace/years-of-lead/

# Or using scp
scp -r ~/Documents/Windsurf/emotional-wellness-api/* user@remote:/workspace/years-of-lead/
```

## Option 4: Manual Upload
Since you're using Cursor:
1. Right-click on your project folder in the file explorer
2. Look for "Upload to Remote" or similar option
3. Select the `/workspace/years-of-lead/` as destination

## Which method would you prefer?
Let me know:
1. If you have a Git repository URL I can clone
2. If you want to use Cursor's upload features
3. If you need help with the command-line sync options

The Git method is usually easiest if your project is already version controlled.
